# Certificates from Online Courses
Certificates from my journey of continuous online learning.

I have used:
* LinkedIn Learning https://www.linkedin.com/learning/ ,
* Pluralsight https://www.pluralsight.com/, 
* Udemy https://www.udemy.com/, 
* Coursera https://www.coursera.org/ ,
* Alison https://alison.com/ ,
* others

This is the manner I used to  improve my skills and gain the new ones I deemed useful.

## “Learning is a Lifelong Process”
“We now accept the fact that learning is a lifelong process of keeping abreast of change. And the most pressing task is to teach people how to learn.” -  Peter Drucker
